# Multiplier2 Wordpress Plugin
This wordpress plugin allows for the implementation of a music instrument and practice tool called Multiplier into my Wordpress website. Multiplier, still being developed, 
is built with React (JavaScript) and leverages the Web Audio and Web MIDI APIs. With this WP plugin it integrates with the WordPress REST API for backend data with MySQL 
and the Patreon API for membership-based feature access.
